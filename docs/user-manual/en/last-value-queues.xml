<chapter id="last-value-queues">
   <title>Last-Value Queues</title>
   <para>Last-Value queues are special queues which discard any messages when a newer message with
      the same value for a well-defined Last-Value property is put in the queue. In other words, a
      Last-Value queue only retains the last value.</para>
   <para>A typical example for Last-Value queue is for stock prices, where you are only interested
      by the latest value for a particular stock.</para>
   <section>
      <title>Configuring Last-Value Queues</title>
      <para>Last-value queues are defined in the address-setting configuration:</para>
      <programlisting>
&lt;address-setting match="jms.queue.lastValueQueue">
   &lt;last-value-queue>true&lt;/last-value-queue>
&lt;/address-setting></programlisting>
      <para>By default, <literal>last-value-queue</literal> is false. Address wildcards can be used
         to configure Last-Value queues for a set of addresses (see <xref linkend="wildcard-syntax"
         />).</para>
   </section>
   <section>
      <title>Using Last-Value Property</title>
      <para>The property name used to identify the last value is <literal>"_HQ_LVQ_NAME"</literal>
         (or the constant <literal>Message.HDR_LAST_VALUE_NAME</literal> from the Core API).</para>
      <para>For example, if two messages with the same value for the Last-Value property are sent to
         a Last-Value queue, only the latest message will be kept in the queue:</para>
      <programlisting>
// send 1st message with Last-Value property set to STOCK_NAME
TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("1st message with Last-Value property set");
message.setStringProperty("_HQ_LVQ_NAME", "STOCK_NAME");
producer.send(message);

// send 2nd message with Last-Value property set to STOCK_NAME             
message = session.createTextMessage("2nd message with Last-Value property set");
message.setStringProperty("_HQ_LVQ_NAME", "STOCK_NAME");
producer.send(message);
       
...
       
// only the 2nd message will be received: it is the latest with 
// the Last-Value property set
TextMessage messageReceived = (TextMessage)messageConsumer.receive(5000);
System.out.format("Received message: %s\n", messageReceived.getText());</programlisting>
   </section>
   <section>
      <title>Example</title>
      <para>See <xref linkend="examples.last-value-queue"/> for an example which shows how last
         value queues are configured and used with JMS.</para>
