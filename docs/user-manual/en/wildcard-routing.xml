<chapter id="wildcard-routing">
    <title>Routing Messages With Wild Cards</title>
    <para>ActiveMQ allows the routing of messages via wildcard addresses.</para>
    <para>If a queue is created with an address of say <literal>queue.news.#</literal> then it
        will receive any messages sent to addresses that match this, for instance <literal
            >queue.news.europe</literal> or <literal>queue.news.usa</literal> or <literal
            >queue.news.usa.sport</literal>. If you create a consumer on this queue, this allows a consumer to consume messages which are
        sent to a <emphasis>hierarchy</emphasis> of addresses.</para>
    <note>
        <para>In JMS terminology this allows "topic hierarchies" to be created.</para>
    </note>
    <para>To enable this functionality set the property <literal>wild-card-routing-enabled</literal>
        in the <literal>activemq-configuration.xml</literal> file to <literal>true</literal>. This is
            <literal>true</literal> by default.</para>
    <para>For more information on the wild card syntax take a look at <xref
            linkend="wildcard-syntax" /> chapter, also see <xref
            linkend="topic-hierarchy-example" />.</para>
