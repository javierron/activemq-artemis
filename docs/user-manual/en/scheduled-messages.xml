   <title>Scheduled Messages</title>
   <para>Scheduled messages differ from normal messages in that they won't be delivered until a
      specified time in the future, at the earliest.</para>
   <para>To do this, a special property is set on the message before sending it.</para>
   <section>
      <title>Scheduled Delivery Property</title>
      <para>The property name used to identify a scheduled message is <literal
            >"_HQ_SCHED_DELIVERY"</literal> (or the constant <literal
            >Message.HDR_SCHEDULED_DELIVERY_TIME</literal>).</para>
      <para>The specified value must be a positive <literal>long</literal> corresponding to the time the
         message must be delivered (in milliseconds). An example of sending a scheduled message
         using the JMS API is as follows.</para>
      <programlisting>
TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("This is a scheduled message message which will be delivered in 5 sec.");
message.setLongProperty("_HQ_SCHED_DELIVERY", System.currentTimeMillis() + 5000);
producer.send(message);

...

// message will not be received immediately but 5 seconds later
TextMessage messageReceived = (TextMessage) consumer.receive();</programlisting>
      <para>Scheduled messages can also be sent using the core API, by setting the same property on
         the core message before sending.</para>
   </section>
   <section>
      <title>Example</title>
      <para>See <xref linkend="examples.scheduled-message"/> for an example which shows how
         scheduled messages can be used with JMS.</para>
